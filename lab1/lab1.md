# Run the Spring Boot Quick Start Demo

## Introduction

This lab walks you through getting setup with Coherence Spring and run the quick start demo application 
which uses Spring's [Cache Abstraction](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache.html) for result caching. 

In this getting started chapter we will look a demo to illustrate basic usage of Oracle Coherence 
when using it with Spring. This demo provides an example of using Coherence Springâ€™s Cache Abstraction.

The demo application is basically a super-simple event manager. We can create Events and assign People to them using an exposed REST API. 
The data is saved in an embedded HSQL database. The caching is implemented at the service layer.

When an Event is created, it is not only persisted to the database but also put to the Coherence Cache. 
Therefore, whenever an Event is retrieved, it will be returned from the Coherence Cache. You can also delete Events, in which case the Event will be evicted from the cache. You can perform the same CRUD operations for people as well.

Estimated time: 15 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Build the coherence-spring-demo
* Understand how Spring Cache Abstraction is implemented
* Run the Spring Boot demo application

> Note: There are more efficient was to integrate Coherence with databases using cache stores, but this is just to show how the out-of-the-box Cache Abstraction works with Spring and Coherence.

### Prerequisites
     
This lab assumes you have:

* An Oracle Free Tier(Trial), Paid or LiveLabs Cloud Account
* You have completed:
  * Lab: Prepare Setup (Free-tier and Paid Tenants only)
  * Lab: Initialize Environment
     
The following has already been setup in this VM:

1. The coherence-spring repository has been cloned from the GitHub repository `https://github.com/coherence-community/coherence-spring.git`.
2. JDK21 and Maven version 3.8.8 has already been installed
3. The [VisualVM Plugin](https://visualvm.github.io/) and associated [Coherence Plugin](https://github.com/oracle/coherence-visualvm) has already been installed 

## Task 1: Build the Coherence Spring Demo Sample

1. Open a new terminal and change to the `coherence-spring/samples/coherence-spring-demo` directory and verify the environment.

      ```bash
      cd ~/coherence-spring/samples/coherence-spring-demo
      mvn -v
      ```   
   
   You will have output similar to the following:

      ```bash
      Apache Maven 3.8.8 (4c87b05d9aedce574290d1acc98575ed5eb6cd39)
      Maven home: /home/opc/Downloads/apache-maven-3.8.8
      Java version: 21.0.5, vendor: Oracle Corporation, runtime: /usr/lib/jvm/jdk-21.0.5-oracle-x64
      Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8
      OS name: "linux", version: "5.15.0-104.119.4.2.el8uek.x86_64", arch: "amd64", family: "unix"
      ```   

2. In the same terminal, issue the following command to start the application:

      ```bash
      mvn clean install -DskipTests
      ```
   
   You should see output similar to the following indicating that the sample has been built:

      ```bash
      [INFO] Reactor Summary for Coherence Spring Demo - Parent 4.3.1-SNAPSHOT:
      [INFO]
      [INFO] Coherence Spring Demo - Parent ..................... SUCCESS [  1.754 s]
      [INFO] Coherence Spring Demo - Core ....................... SUCCESS [  4.057 s]
      [INFO] Coherence Spring Demo - Classic Spring Framework ... SUCCESS [ 16.670 s]
      [INFO] Coherence Spring Demo - Spring Boot ................ SUCCESS [ 24.166 s]

      [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
      ``` 
     
3. In the above output you can see three submodules 
            
   * Coherence Spring Demo - Core (coherence-spring-demo-core) - Contains common code shared between the following two apps
   * Coherence Spring Demo - Spring Boot (coherence-spring-demo-boot) - Provides a demo using Spring Boot
   * Coherence Spring Demo - Classic Spring Framework (coherence-spring-demo-classic) - Provides a demo using Spring Framework without Spring Boot - *We will not be running this demo*
                     

## Task 2: Run The Spring Boot Demo Application

1. In the existing terminal, ensure you are in the `~/coherence-spring/samples/coherence-spring-demo` directory and run the application.

      ```bash
      pwd
      /home/opc/coherence-spring/samples/coherence-spring-demo  
      java -Dcoherence.wka=127.0.0.1 -jar coherence-spring-demo-boot/target/coherence-spring-demo-boot-4.3.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 
      ```                            
   
   > Note: We specify `-Dcoherence.wka=127.0.0.1` to ensure the Coherence cluster is confined to the local machine.

## Task 3: Add events and verify the Coherence cache

1. Open a new terminal tab by using `File->New Tab` and use `curl` to create an event

      ```bash
      curl --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/api/events?title=First%20Event&date=2025-01-30'
      ```   

   You should see output similar to the following indicating that the Event has been stored.

      ```json
      {
       "id" : 1,
       "title" : "First Event",
       "date" : "2025-01-30T00:00:00.000+00:00"
      }
      ```  
   
   This call will create and persist an Event to the database. However, there is more going on. 
   The created Event is also added to the Coherence Cache. The magic is happening in the Service layer, 
   specifically in [DefaultEventService#createAndStoreEvent()](https://github.com/coherence-community/coherence-spring/blob/b285ad6ff3eb80e4d6530f91aae991fb69f6dd65/samples/coherence-spring-demo/coherence-spring-demo-core/src/main/java/com/oracle/coherence/spring/demo/service/impl/DefaultEventService.java#L43), shown below, 
   which is annotated with `@CachePut(cacheNames="events", key="#result.id")`.

      ```java
      @CachePut(cacheNames="events", key="#result.id")
	  @Override
	  public Event createAndStoreEvent(String title, Date date) {
         final Event event = new Event();
 		 event.setTitle(title);
		 event.setDate(date);

		 final Event savedEvent = this.eventRepository.save(event);
		 return savedEvent;
	  }
     ```  
   
   The cacheNames attribute of the @CachePut annotation indicates the name of the underlying cache to use. 
   As caches are basically just a Map (partitioned across many nodes), we also need a key. In this case we 
   use the expression #result.id to retrieve the primary key of the Event as it was persisted. Thus, 
   the saved Event is added to the cache named events and ultimately also returned and printed to the console.
     
   > Note: We will cover the code in more detail further down in this lab.
   
2. Verify the data is in the Coherence cache by running the VisualVM tool. Open a new terminal tab by using `File->New Tab` and run the following:

      ```bash
      cd ~/visualvm_2110/bin
      ./visualvm
      ```   
   
   Once it starts up, you should see a screen similar to the following: <<INSERT SCREENSHOT of VISUALVM>>

   Open `Tools->Options` and click on the `Coherence` tab. Change the `Data Refresh Time` to 7 seconds and click on `OK`.

3. Double-click the `coherence-spring-demo-boot-4.3.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` process, and select the `Coherence Tab`.  You may need to expand the window to see the full tab.

   <<IMAGE OF COHERENCE TAB OPENED>>

4. Click on `Caches` sub-tab and then select `PartitionedCache / events` and you will see there is one entry and there has been one put which was done automatically via the   

5. Retrieve the event using the following:
  
      ```bash
      curl --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/api/events/1'
      ```   

   You should see output similar to the following indicating that the Event has been retrieve.

      ```json
      {
       "id" : 1,
       "title" : "First Event",
       "date" : "2025-01-30T00:00:00.000+00:00"
      }
      ```   
   
   If you check VisualVM, you will see that the number of gets is now one, which means it was retrieved from the Cache. 
   You should also see no SQL statement being shown on the application log as well confirming this.
 
   > Note: For this example we are only using an in memory database, but you can image if your database call takes 10-20ms, then returning
   > the data from teh cache instead of the database, significantly reduces the access time and takes load off the backend database.

   <<IMAGE SHOWING GETS 1>>

6. Delete or evict the event using the following:
  
      ```bash
      curl --request DELETE 'http://localhost:8080/api/events/1'
      ```
   
   If you check VisualVM, you will see that the count of entries in teh cache is now zero.

   <<IMAGE SHOWING NO ENTRIES IN CACH>>

7. Retrieve the entry again, and you will see that the number of cache entries is now one, and you can see the SQL to load the event from the DB and then it is placed in the cache.
  
      ```bash
      curl --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/api/events/1'
      ```
   
   If you check VisualVM, you will see that the count of entries in teh cache is now one.

   <<IMAGE SHOWING NO ENTRIES IN CACH>>


## Task 4: Add people and verify the Coherence cache

1. In an existing terminal, run the following two curl commands to add two people:

      ```bash
       curl --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/api/people?firstName=Conrad&lastName=Zuse&age=85'
       curl --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/api/people?firstName=Alan&lastName=Turing&age=41'
      ```   

   You will see output showing `1` and `2` which are the automatically generated ID's.

   Note: The people api only has the `GET /api/people/id` method cached in [DefaultPersonService#getPerson()](https://github.com/coherence-community/coherence-spring/blob/b285ad6ff3eb80e4d6530f91aae991fb69f6dd65/samples/coherence-spring-demo/coherence-spring-demo-core/src/main/java/com/oracle/coherence/spring/demo/service/impl/DefaultPersonService.java#L51) as shown below.
   
      ```java
      @Cacheable(cacheNames="people", key="#personId")
	  @Override
  	  public Person getPerson(Long personId) {
         return this.personRepository.findById(personId).get();
	  }
      ```

2. Issue the following two curl requests to get both people:

      ```bash
       curl --request DELETE 'http://localhost:8080/api/people/1'
       curl --request DELETE 'http://localhost:8080/api/people/2'
      ```   
   
3. Check VisualVM and confirm that there are two entries for the people cache.
